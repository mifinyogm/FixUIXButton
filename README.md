# FixUIXButton

This mod was created to fix UIX canvases occasionally becoming unresponsive from changes to their hierarchy.

#### The button only works for the user who created it, and also only fixes it for the person who pressed the button.

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) which adds a button to RectTransforms that refreshes them which seems to fix broken uix that has stopped updating.
